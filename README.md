# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-and-K-means
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using the Online Retail II dataset. After cleaning the data, I created RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features and applied K-Means clustering to identify meaningful customer segments. The goal is to help businesses understand customer value, improve retention, and target marketing more effectively.
Key Steps
• 	Loaded and cleaned over 800k transaction records
• 	Engineered RFM features
• 	Scaled features for clustering
• 	Selected the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores
• 	Applied K-Means clustering
• 	Visualized clusters using PCA
• 	Interpreted customer segments and provided business recommendations
Results
The model identified three customer segments:
1. 	Dormant Low-Value Customers
2. 	Active Mid-Value Customers
3. 	High-Value Power Buyers
These segments support targeted marketing strategies and revenue optimization.
Tools Used
• 	Python
• 	Pandas
• 	NumPy
• 	Matplotlib
